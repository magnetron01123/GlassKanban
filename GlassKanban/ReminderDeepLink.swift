/// Resolves the URL that opens one specific reminder in the Reminders app.
///
/// Background: the (undocumented) scheme is
/// `x-apple-reminderkit://REMCDReminder/<UUID>`, but the UUID it expects is
/// the Reminders-internal record UUID — NOT EventKit's
/// `calendarItemIdentifier`. The only public source for that UUID is
/// `calendarItemExternalIdentifier`, which for CloudKit-backed (iCloud/
/// CalDAV/Exchange) reminders is typically "x-apple-reminder://<UUID>".
///
/// Local ("On My Mac") reminders have no external identifier at all — there
/// is no public API that exposes their internal UUID — so this resolves to
/// `nil` for them and the caller falls back to simply opening the Reminders
/// app. That is an acceptable gap here: editing a reminder's content no
/// longer depends on this deep link (see `TicketEditSheet`), so this is now
/// only a shortcut into the native app, not the sole way to reach a
/// reminder's content. An earlier version of this resolver used a private,
/// reflection-based fallback (`backingObject` → `_reminder` → `uuid`, the
/// same trick the open-source app "Reminders MenuBar" uses) to cover this
/// gap — removed once the in-app editor made it unnecessary, since Mac App
/// Store Guideline 2.5.1 prohibits private/undocumented API use.
